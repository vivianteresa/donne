My Dear sir

[agreeably to your request I should have eludicated]
Mr Gales [algebraic demonstration] theorem relative to the value
of annuity stocks, the worth of which he has demonstrated by an algebraic [process]
process. I have confirmed by an [algeb] arithmetic computation
and which you will have inclosed.

Mr Gale in his second Essay page 72 and in his third Essay
page 60, posits that he has left [something] a particular unexplained relative
to the conversion of the debt, without [which] the knowledge of which
the practical financier would bring a considerable loss on the
public, the discovery of what this unexplained business is he thinks
rather improbable.- "unless the subject should be retaken up as far
back as the postulata in the second section of the first Essay: and
pursued from thence with an immensity of labors through paths
that [I have] he as (as he says) purposely passed by in silence" I think I have
discovered what he alludes to and in the paper No 2. you will
see [that] it detailed, [both] where it is demonstrated that a considerable loss,
must necessarily be sustained by the public if the particular is not attended
to, he has also I [can see] alluded to a particular mode, of making
the loans that shall be requisite, beyond the amount of the
revenue, to pay the periodical redemption money, for it is
evident to me, that if the loans are not properly conducted, the
public will be so much in the power of the money lenders that they
[may] rather may insist on a much larger premium than the former
ought to give. This you will see explained in Number 3d.

This [reason] [probable] reason which [in probability] deterred Mr Pitt from
adopting Mr Gales plan has rather to my knowledge been
given.- [One] has however latterly [answered] to me, and which



appears to me of sufficient weight to justify that man is [?]
for not entering in the business, precisely in the manner
proposed by Mr Gale, which you will recollect was to estimate
the value of the new stock on the depreciated value of the
[the] three per cents sh[ow]ing the mean value of the latter at
63 1/3, by which the public would share [nearly] or rather
recover nearly what they had lost by the enormous
premiums which have been given but such an estimate of the three per cents
might be considered as taking an undue advantage of the
creditors, who [ought] would expect [ought] to be paid the nominal capital which
they received for the money they lent, be the latter more or
less - Indeed if the conversion was made on the nominal
capital, the debt in the new stock would be greater, and consequently
the greater revenue must be [applied] provided for payments
of the interest, but still the power of the [lending?] fund
[would] [app????] [from] t the redemption. If [irredeemably?] applied
would be such, as in about 25 years to superceed the necessity
of any loans for the payment of the annual tender for
the redemption. - and thence forward (the revenue which at
the commencement of the conversion was sufficient for the
[first] years interest) would be an accumulating [something] [pounds]
which would always keep the debt within moderate bounds
nay at any point which prudence and the weal of the
nation should dictate, even altho wars and their
attendant expenses should prevail as often as they
have done in the present century -



These papers all so clearly evince the propriety
of borrowing on a high interest, when were it may
be necessary to borrow money, that I hope every
future loan to the United States will be made
on these principles. - and in order that no error
may be made in the compacts with the lenders
I have shown the terms which you will find
[h-N-n] - Ever yours affectly

P--

Hon A. Hamilton Esqr

P.S. whether you shall remain in or resign the Superintendence
of the treasury department, it seems to me equally
proper that you should establish the principle on which
all future loans should be made, such as that the means
of redemption should invariable be annexed to the loans
[power] an accumulation of debt will always be
prevented without additional burthens on the people
and setting out on this system advantages will accrue
which no nation having a public debt has ever [had]
yet experienced. - the credit will be yours and
posterity will bless your memory for having
produced a system so replete with salutary
consequences - once more affectionately yours,

Ph. Schuyler
