			<line>L.b.542 26 ? Sir ? The busines of thys churche, and all other busines which con- ? cerne me in thys town determine thys weeke so that I ? might be at my liberty to go to do the duty to my ? churche in the Cuntry, next weeke, but for the expec- ? tation of that 100l, , which ^you are to pay some days after that. ? If therfore yt stand not with your conveniency to pay yt before, ? because I presume yow wyll be gone out of town, before that ? ?11th of July, I ame bold to intreat yow to let me know, by whose ? hands yt shall be payd me then. for besides that yt were a ? great disappointment of my necessary service in the Cuntry, ? to be stayd any longer in thys town, so not to receyve yt at that ? day, wyll put me to so great a trouble, as to make my poore ? wyll anew, and to subtract from my other children, theyr ? part of thys 100l. . Therfore I humbly intreat yow, that I may ? hear from yow, before your goinge out of town, and rest ? your poore sonne in law, and ? humble servant in Christ Iesus ? Iohn Donne ? ? ? At Pauls house. ? ?22 Iune 1629.?</line>
